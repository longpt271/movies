# Movie Trailer Website

## Info
This Git repository contains the source code and assets for our Movie Trailer Website project. It is a web platform designed for watching and discovering movie trailers.

## Description
The Movie Trailer Website is a user-friendly platform that provides a collection of movie trailers for various films. Users can browse through trailers, read brief descriptions, and explore new and classic movies. From there you can find your favorite movie to watch.

## Future

- Integration with user ratings and reviews for movies, allowing viewers to share their opinions and recommendations.
- Further improving the user interface for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to help make this project even better.
